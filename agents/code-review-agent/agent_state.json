      "summary": "The code provides a basic conversational interface to a Gemini model. While functional, it has areas for improvement. The script relies heavily on environment variables and lacks proper configuration and error handling. Additionally, it uses a 'preview' module, which is not ideal for production.  Logging and a more robust model selection strategy would increase its maintainability and usability. Further development could also include additional input validation and prompt formatting for better responses."
